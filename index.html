        <h1>How we integrate science with technology to create a sustainable future</h1>
        <br>
        <p>We may have heard of how science and technology were used to create a sustainable future. Let's look into some examples to understand the topic better.</p>

        <h2>1.Renewable Energy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>For the unversed renewable energy is when we use energy that does not run out. The entire world is powered by mostly non-renewable energy i.e. coal energy. This causes a lot of pollution and as you have heard about the recent power shortage in India non-renewable energy will eventually run out. Renewable energy solves this sustainability issue. Solar energy for example can generate electricity from the light that hits the solar panels. This not only helps in reversing climate change but is nowadays pretty cheap to install.</p>

        <h2>2.Smog Free Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Daan Roosegaarde is the mastermind behind the world's first smog vacuum cleaner. The Smog Free Tower measures almost 23 feet high (7 meters) and sucks in polluted air, cleaning it through a process of ionization before releasing it again. At its peak performance, the tower cleans 30,000 m3 of air per hour.
            Thanks to Roosegaarde's design, you can even wear rings made from the compressed smog particles collected from the tower. By buying and wearing a Smog Free Ring, you're contributing to over 10,700 square feet (1000 square meters) of clean air. The project has garnered a lot of attention since its inception, winning multiple awards. Recent tower campaigns have been launched in South Korea, China, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Poland.</p>

        <h2>3. The Green Building Initiative</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Green Building Initiative (GBI) is an international effort towards creating sustainable, resource-efficient buildings. They offer a certification program for commercial buildings that adhere to their environmentally-friendly vision. Their goal is to establish a standard of best practices for green buildings globally, as well as providing third-party assessment tools for sustainability requirements.</p>

        <p>These are just a few in many examples of sustainable development with science and technology. Now let's see this scratch animation to understand why we should use sustainable development in the first place</p>
